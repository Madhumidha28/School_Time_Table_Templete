## School Timetable Showcase (HTML Project)

  This project demonstrates multiple ways to represent a school timetable using only HTML & CSS.

[Live Demo : 🔗]()

## Perspectives Covered
  
  **Horizontal Timetable** – Days in rows, periods in columns.
  **Vertical Timetable** – Time slots in rows, days in columns.
  **Comprehensive School Timetable** – A professional layout including Morning Assembly, Break, Lunch, and signature sections.

## Comparison

  **Horizontal Timetable**
      ✅ Easy to compare all periods for a single day.
      ❌ Can become too wide on smaller screens, requiring horizontal scrolling.
  
  **Vertical Timetable**
      ✅ Easy to see what is scheduled at the same time across different days.
      ❌ Longer vertical layout, leading to repeated headings and more scrolling.
  
  **Comprehensive Timetable**
      ✅ Realistic school format, well-organized, with additional details for authenticity.
      ❌ Requires more space; may need formatting adjustments for printing.

## Learning Path

  I began by creating the **Horizontal Timetable** to understand table structure, then built the **Vertical Timetable** to practice alternative layouts, and     
  finally designed the **Comprehensive Timetable** to include realistic school details.

  This project is continuously improving — the next planned update is to add **CSS styling** for:

   **Color themes to make each timetable visually distinct**
   **Controlled column widths for better readability**
   **Responsive adjustments for different screen sizes**
