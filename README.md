## School Timetable Showcase (HTML Project)

  This project demonstrates multiple ways to represent a school timetable using only HTML & CSS.

[Live Demo : üîó]
  - [Horizontal Timetable]    : (https://madhumidha28.github.io/School_Time_Table_Templete/)
  - [Vertical Timetable]      : (https://madhumidha28.github.io/School_Time_Table_Templete/vertical_timetable.html)
  - [Comprehensive Timetable] : (https://madhumidha28.github.io/School_Time_Table_Templete/comprehensive_timetable.html)

## Perspectives Covered
  
  1.**Horizontal Timetable** ‚Äì Days in rows, periods in columns.
  2.**Vertical Timetable** ‚Äì Time slots in rows, days in columns.
  3.**Comprehensive School Timetable** ‚Äì A professional layout including Morning Assembly, Break, Lunch, and signature sections.
  ***For brevity, Monday is fully detailed in the comprehensive version; other days follow the same pattern.***

## Comparison

  1.**Horizontal Timetable**
      ‚úÖ Easy to compare all periods for a single day.
      ‚ùå Can become too wide on smaller screens, requiring horizontal scrolling.
  
  2.**Vertical Timetable**
      ‚úÖ Easy to see what is scheduled at the same time across different days.
      ‚ùå Longer vertical layout, leading to repeated headings and more scrolling.
  
  3.**Comprehensive Timetable**
      ‚úÖ Realistic school format, well-organized, with additional details for authenticity.
      ‚ùå Requires more space; may need formatting adjustments for printing.

## Learning Path

  I began by creating the **Horizontal Timetable** to understand table structure, then built the **Vertical Timetable** to practice alternative layouts, and     
  finally designed the **Comprehensive Timetable** to include realistic school details.


  This project is continuously improving ‚Äî the next planned update is to add **CSS styling** for:

   - **Color themes to make each timetable visually distinct**
   - **Controlled column widths for better readability**
   - **Responsive adjustments for different screen sizes**
